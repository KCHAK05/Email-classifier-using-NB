# Email-classifier-using-NB

Here we have shown one of the most important models in ML which is an email classifier .This model basically classifies any email as  spam or not spam.

We have used the concept of Naive Bayes to make the model and the packages that we have used are pandas, numpy, from sklearn.feature_extraction.text we imported the Vectorizer and from sklearn.naive_bayes I imported the MultinomialNB to help us in making our tasks a bit more simple.

We have also used the os and the io files to read the emails and write on certain files in the notebook.

I have also attached the email files ( which contain the spam and the ham files ) that has been used in the making of the model.
